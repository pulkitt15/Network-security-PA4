# Network Security PA-4

Implement any two PRNGs in a language of your choice. Run any two randomness tests over them and report the result.

We have implemented PRNGs - Blum-Blum-Shub Generator(BBSG) and Exclusive OR Generator (XORG).
For randomness tests, we have used Frequency Test and Runs Test.
